        <ul>
            <li>You'll be welcomed, but not pressured to share</li>
            <li>You can simply listen if you prefer</li>
            <li>Everything shared in meetings is confidential</li>
            <li>You'll likely hear stories that resonate with your experiences</li>
            <li>Most people report feeling a sense of relief after their first meeting</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Remember: Everyone in the room has been where you are now. Taking that first step is the hardest part.</p>
